      <description>One of the core features of the Xeneta platform is the ability to benchmark your rates against the market. Benchmarking is another way of saying &amp;ldquo;comparing&amp;rdquo; â€” that is, you compare the prices you pay for shipping against other market participants as a whole.
Benchmarking can help you understand how much you pay relative to the market and can, in turn, give you the insight you need to negotiate better rates in the future.</description>
