      <description>In this guide, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at using Xeneta to compare your uploaded freight rates to current and historical market rates. Introduction The Benchmarks graph is designed to help you compare your freight rates against the market. At its core, it plots Xeneta&amp;rsquo;s market benchmarks alongside your own freight rates.
 The Benchmarks graph can be reached in two ways:
 Clicking the View Graph button from the dashboard search after searching for a trade lane or trade corridor Clicking the View Graph button from the Market Trends page if you have followed trade lanes  Filtering Your Data The Benchmark graph contains a number of filters to help you narrow the scope of the market such that you can compare your prices to the most relevant segments of the market.</description>

      <description>What is a freight rate? A freight rate is a negotiated price for shipping a freight container from one part of the world to another.
Freight rates that are tied to contracts have a validity period that defines the length of time that the freight rate is valid. The validity of a freight rate will depend on if it is based on a short-term contract or a long-term contract.</description>

Spend Comparison The Spend Comparison — available on the Analytics dashboard — helps you compare the price you paid for your volume you have shipped against shipping the same volume at different market prices. The Spend Comparison panel compares your spend volume to the market low, average, and high spends.
Example: If you ship 100 TEU at $100 each, the value of My Covered Spend will be $10,000.</description>

      <description>One of the core features of the Xeneta platform is the ability to benchmark your rates against the market. Benchmarking is another way of saying &amp;ldquo;comparing&amp;rdquo; — that is, you compare the prices you pay for shipping against other market participants as a whole.
Benchmarking can help you understand how much you pay relative to the market and can, in turn, give you the insight you need to negotiate better rates in the future.</description>

      <description>In this guide, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at working with Excel to look at Xeneta&amp;rsquo;s Benchmarking data by exploring a few basic examples. Introduction Xeneta can export the data that composes the Benchmarks graph to an Excel report.
To begin, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to generate the Benchmarks graph for the trade lane or trade corridor whose data we wish to export. Use the dashboard search or your followed trade lanes to reach the Benchmarks graph.</description>

      <description>In this guide, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at the Contract Horizon feature to examine where the freight market is trending past the present day. Introduction The Xeneta platform provides market trends and benchmarks based on current and historical freight rates. Of course, in the cycle of freight procurement and contract negotiation, new shipping contracts are always being established.
In these cases, the contracts negotiated near the present day may be contracted to start a few weeks or months in the future — but they are still signed today and reflect today&amp;rsquo;s market.</description>
