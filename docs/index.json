	"content": " \rAn Introduction to Freight Rate Benchmarking and Analytics for Ocean Freight\r What is a freight rate? A freight rate is a negotiated or quoted price for shipping a freight container from one part of the world to another.\nFreight rates that are tied to contracts have a validity period that defines the length of time that the freight rate is valid. The validity of a freight rate will depend on if it is based on a short-term contract or a long-term contract.\nXeneta considers short-term contracts to be less than 32 days and long-term contracts to be longer than 88 days in terms of their validity.\nTrade Lanes Freight rates are tied to specific trade lanes.\nA trade lane is a route from an origin port to a destination port on which freight is shipped. Because logistics of port to port shipping are complex, a freight rate will sometimes include multiple smaller ports as part of the larger route. The price of moving the freight between the smaller ports and the larger ports may very well be included in the total freight rate.\nAt its core, Xeneta provides a price benchmark for shipping freight between most ports globally.\nSurcharges Freight rates are typically associated with a number of surcharges. Surcharges are additional fees involved with transporting the freight container, such as loading the container, processing the cargo documentation, or providing security for the container.\nMany surcharges are common to all service providers: fuel fees, documentation fees, and piracy fees. Other surcharges vary based on the carrier, port, global events, and seasons. A common charge applied to cargo based on the location of the port is the terminal handling charge, which is the fee paid for loading and unloading cargo at the port of origin and destination.\nIn summary, the total cost of shipping a freight container is the combination of the base freight rate and additional surcharges.\nAggregation A single rate by itself will not say very much about the freight market.\nXeneta offers insight into the freight rate market by collecting freight rates from across many participants in the market, including Beneficial Cargo Owners (BCOs) and Freight Forwarders (FFs).\nAs a platform, Xeneta provides an aggregated high-level view of the freight market. When we say aggregation, we mean that across a single trade lane many valid rates are combined into a single value — usually a market average — to provide a clear picture of what the market prices as a whole are like on that trade lane.\nAggregation is done historically, for the current day, and for long-term contracts extending past the current day.\nBenchmarking Because Xeneta offers an aggregated value that depicts the freight market at large, this value can be used to benchmark your own freight rates against the market.\nXeneta offers five market positions that illustrate different parts of the market. In this way, you can compare your prices against the market average, as well as the best and worst performers across the entire spread of the market.\nBy comparing your own prices to the market, you can understand where your organization can find improvements and efficiencies. Moreover, Xeneta\u0026rsquo;s analytics can show you the saving potentials — that is, the possible savings in dollars — of your organization.\nUploading Your Freight Rates To be able to benchmark your own freight rates against the market, your organization will need to upload its freight rates into the Xeneta platform.\nXeneta\u0026rsquo;s Transformation of Freight Rates There is no standard for categorizing freight rates across the whole of the shipping industry. Organizations will provide freight rate information in an internal format, mostly incomparable to freight rate information provided by others.\nWhile there is overlapping content, such as the freight rate itself, expressed as a cost for shipping a single type of container \u0026ndash; 20 foot, 40 foot, high cube, and so on \u0026ndash; the finer details will vary.\nWhen processing freight rate data, Xeneta transforms the various disparate formats received from market participants into a form that can be compared. This step relies on the expertise of our Rate Management Team, who leverage their market understanding to extract key information from market freight rates and construct the final set of Xeneta market data, which is then offered on the Xeneta platform.\nGlobal Coverage Xeneta receives freight rates from customers engaged in trade all over the world.\nWhen complete trade lane data is unavailable, Xeneta uses regional aggregation based on our geo-hierarchy methodology to show freight rates between larger geographic regions.\nIn other cases, Xeneta computes estimated rates that provide calculated approximations of what prices might be like for trade lanes lacking freight rate data.\nWhat Can I Use Xeneta For? At its core, the Xeneta platform helps you understand the ocean freight market and your position relative to it. Take a look at some of the use cases for Xeneta to see how it can benefit your organization.\nNext Steps Next, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at how the Xeneta platform displays freight rate information in its interface.\nMarket Metrics\r "

	"content": " For an in-depth look at Market Metrics, read our article in the help center.\r Market metrics are a set of options that control how freight rate data is displayed in Xeneta. You can think of them as a global-level filters for rate information.\nThey appear in the top-right corner of on any pages capable of showing freight data — including Air and Ocean dashboards.\nMarket metrics for ocean freight.\r\r Currently, Xeneta uses 3 types of market metrics across both Ocean and Air freight products:\n Contract duration (Ocean) Market position (Air and Ocean) Service levels (Air)\n  Understanding Your Metrics — Ocean It is important to select the right market metrics when viewing data in Xeneta because market metrics determine the data you will be shown.\nXeneta separates data between short-term contracts and long-term contracts, which means that you need to use market metrics to select the type of contracts you would prefer to see. Additionally, long-term contracts can be filtered by their age using the Contracted Within option.\nXeneta also allows you to focus on different parts of the market, including the average freight rates, as well as the low and high segments of the market. You can read more about how Xeneta divides prices into different segments of the freight market here.\nWith this in mind, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the following freight rate search results and see how they are affected by market metrics:\nShort-term Contracts and Market Average Position In this case, Xeneta returns the market average price across all short term contracts available on the Shanghai–Hamburg trade lane.\nRate from Shanghai to Hamburg with short-term rates and a market average position.\r\r Short-term Contracts and Market High Position Here we can see the same short term contracts but the market position is now focused on the market high, or, in other words, the highest prices paid on the market to ship freight on this trade lane.\nRate from Shanghai to Hamburg with short-term rates and a market high position.\r\r Long-term Contracts and Market Low Position Finally, we can see long-term contracts with the market low position — that is, the lowest prices paid by market participants.\nRate from Shanghai to Hamburg with long-term rates and a market low position.\r\r Summary The market metrics determine the parts of the freight rate market that Xeneta will show. In the examples above, the freight rate can vary drastically under different market metrics. The price of long-term contracts will differ from the short-term, and the market average value can be significantly different between the highest and lowest prices paid on the market.\nUnderstanding Your Metrics — Air Market metrics in Xeneta for Air Freight differ from Ocean freight in the following ways:\n Air freight uses only long-term contracts Air freight has a market metric tied to the service level of the cargo  Market metrics for Air freight.\r\r Like Ocean freight, Xeneta uses three different market positions to show freight rates for the market average, low, and high segments.\nHowever, unlike Ocean freight, air freight is categorized by Xeneta into service levels. This is done to ensure that air cargo, which lacks the standardization of ocean freight, can be made comparable to other air cargo.\nIn general, the way Xeneta creates benchmarks for air freight differs from the way it is done for ocean freight. You can read more about our benchmarking methodology here.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s examine how the service level market metric affects the prices seen within the air freight search:\nMid-Tier Service Level and Market Average Here we can see the prices for air freight from Shanghai to Frankfurt at the market average.\nMid-tier service level and a market average position.\r\r Mid-Tier Service Level and Market Low Contrast the price above with the same service tier but focused on the lowest price on the market. We can see that the spread between the market average and the market low is not very large.\nMid-tier service level and a market low position.\r\r Low-Tier Service Level and Market Average Finally, we can look at the low-tier service level at the market average for the same trade lane.\nLow-tier service level and a market average position.\r\r The difference between the low-tier and mid-tier air freight viewed at the market average provides a good insight into the value of service level offered by carriers. For instance, if you\u0026rsquo;re particularly price-sensitive, it would make sense to forgo some service level benefits — like shipping speed — for a lower price.\n"
