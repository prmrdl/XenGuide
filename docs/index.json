	"content": " Introduction Xeneta can visualize market movements with its graphing functionality. This is immediately useful for identifying how the market reacts to world events and gives you the insight to be proactive about your freight procurement.\nLong-term vs. Short-term As an example, we\u0026rsquo;ll take a look at the trends of the past year between China East Main and the US West Coast from 12-10-2019  to 12-10-2020\r.\n View example in Xeneta  In the image above, we have plotted the short-term (yellow) and long-term (blue) market averages for the past year. We can clearly see that by October 2020 the price to ship freight on short-term contracts is almost double the price of running long-term contracts in that period. The rapid increase in short-term prices began around June and continued to rise until October, where it stabilized.\nWith short-term prices significantly above long-term prices, the market will tend to strongly prefer shipping freight on short-term contracts. This suggests that, as a result, market participants with long-term contracts will see much of their cargo getting rolled.\nSurcharges Coming into IMO 2020, most market players were unsure of what would happen to prices when the new surcharge came into effect worldwide. In the image below, we have a snapshot of the Shanghai to Hamburg tradelane around the beginning of 2020.\n View example in Xeneta  Using Xeneta\u0026rsquo;s data to look back on the market clearly shows an across-the-board price increase. However, while market prices initially shot up, they quickly settled over the next few months, and for the most part prices are not vastly different from before the new surcharge.\nWhile Xeneta does not speculate about future prices, it can still help you identify market movements and can prepare your organization for a change in market strategy.\n"

By default, the Benchmarks graph looks back one year from the present day.\nSecondarily, the graph contains a Contract Duration filter to help you select which type of market rates — short-term or long-term — you want to have compared to your own uploaded rates.\nFor a better look at your uploaded rates, you can use the My Prices page to examine your freight volume and its associated prices.\nSelecting Your Suppliers Below the graph, you can find the My Prices table, which lists all of the suppliers that you have contracted rates for on the selected trade lane or corridor.\n To select a supplier, mouse over the row of the supplier you wish to add and click the Add button.\n If you have multiple suppliers, you can use the Suppliers filter at the top of the page to find the suppliers relevant to your benchmarking.\n Once you select a supplier, their rates will be plotted on the Benchmarks graph:\n Finally, use the Market Position legend to the right of the graph to select one or more market positions to use as a benchmark against your selected supplier.\n Hover your cursor over the graph to get detailed pricing information for all plotted lines:\n Understanding the Benchmarks Graph With both the market prices and your own supplier prices plotted on the graph, you can begin to ask questions about your procurement strategy.\nConsider how your prices compare to the market average, as well as market low and market high segments. Do you tend to pay for freight above or below the market? How do your fright rates prices compare month over month and year over year?\nThese are all questions that can help you towards optimizing your ocean freight process.\n"

	"content": " What is a freight rate? A freight rate is a negotiated price for shipping a freight container from one part of the world to another.\nFreight rates that are tied to contracts have a validity period that defines the length of time that the freight rate is valid. The validity of a freight rate will depend on if it is based on a short-term contract or a long-term contract.\nXeneta considers short-term contracts to be less than 32 days and long-term contracts to be longer than 88 days in terms of their validity.\nTrade Lanes Freight rates are tied to specific trade lanes.\nA trade lane is a route from an origin port to a destination port on which freight is shipped. Because logistics of port to port shipping are complex, a freight rate will sometimes include multiple smaller ports as part of the larger route. The price of moving the freight between the smaller ports and the larger ports may very well be included in the total freight rate.\nAt its core, Xeneta provides a price benchmark for shipping freight between most ports globally.\nSurcharges Freight rates are typically associated with a number of surcharges. Surcharges are additional fees involved with transporting the freight container, such as loading the container, processing the cargo documentation, or providing security for the container.\nMany surcharges are common to all service providers: fuel fees, documentation fees, and piracy fees. Other surcharges vary based on the carrier, port, global events, and seasons. A common charge applied to cargo based on the location of the port is the terminal handling charge, which is the fee paid for handling and moving cargo at the port of origin and destination.\nIn summary, the total cost of shipping a freight container is the combination of the base freight rate and additional surcharges.\nAggregation A single rate by itself will not say very much about the freight market.\nXeneta offers insight into the freight rate market by collecting freight rates from across many participants in the market, including Beneficial Cargo Owners (BCOs) and Freight Forwarders (FFs).\nAs a platform, Xeneta provides an aggregated high-level view of the freight market. When we say aggregation, we mean that across a single trade lane many valid rates are combined into a single value — usually a market average — to provide a clear picture of what the market prices as a whole are like on that trade lane.\nAll market data presented by Xeneta is anonymized, aggregated data.\nBenchmarking Because Xeneta offers an aggregated value that depicts the freight market at large, this value can be used to benchmark your own freight rates against the market.\nXeneta offers five market positions that illustrate different parts of the market. In this way, you can compare your prices against the market average, as well as the best and worst performers across the entire spread of the market.\nBy comparing your own prices to the market, you can understand where your organization can find improvements and efficiencies. Moreover, Xeneta\u0026rsquo;s analytics can show you the saving potentials — that is, the possible savings in dollars — of your organization.\nUploading Your Freight Rates To be able to benchmark your own freight rates against the market, your organization will need to upload its freight rates into the Xeneta platform.\nXeneta\u0026rsquo;s Transformation of Freight Rates There is no standard for categorizing freight rates across the whole of the shipping industry. Organizations will provide freight rate information in an internal format, mostly incomparable to freight rate information provided by others.\nWhile there is overlapping content, such as the freight rate itself, expressed as a cost for shipping a single type of container \u0026ndash; 20 foot, 40 foot, high cube, and so on \u0026ndash; the finer details will vary.\nWhen processing freight rate data, Xeneta transforms the various disparate formats received from market participants into a form that can be compared. This step relies on the expertise of our Rate Management Team, who leverage their market understanding to extract key information from market freight rates and construct the final set of Xeneta market data, which is then offered on the Xeneta platform.\nGlobal Coverage Xeneta receives freight rates from customers engaged in trade all over the world.\nWhen complete trade lane data is unavailable, Xeneta uses regional aggregation based on our geo-hierarchy methodology to show freight rates between larger geographic regions.\nIn other cases, Xeneta computes estimated rates that provide calculated approximations of what prices might be like for trade lanes lacking freight rate data.\nWhat can I use Xeneta for? At its core, the Xeneta platform helps you understand the ocean freight market and your position within it. Take a look at our Quickstart Guide to see how it can benefit your organization.\nNext Steps Next, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at how the Xeneta platform displays freight rate information in its interface.\nRead about Market Metrics →\r\r "

	"content": " For an in-depth look at Market Metrics, read our article in the help center.\r Market metrics are a set of options that control how freight rate data is displayed in Xeneta. You can think of them as a global-level filters for rate information.\nThey appear in the top-right corner of on any pages capable of showing freight data — including Air and Ocean dashboards.\n Currently, Xeneta uses 3 types of market metrics across both Ocean and Air freight products:\n Contract duration (Ocean) Market position (Air and Ocean) Service levels (Air)\n  Understanding Your Metrics — Ocean It is important to select the right market metrics when viewing data in Xeneta because market metrics determine the data you will be shown.\nXeneta separates data between short-term contracts and long-term contracts, which means that you need to use market metrics to select the type of contracts you would prefer to see. Additionally, long-term contracts can be filtered by their age using the Contracted Within option.\nXeneta also allows you to focus on different parts of the market, including the average freight rates, as well as the low and high segments of the market. You can read more about how Xeneta divides prices into different segments of the freight market here.\nWith this in mind, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the following freight rate search results and see how they are affected by market metrics:\nShort-term Contracts and Market Average Position In this case, Xeneta returns the market average price across all short term contracts available on the Shanghai–Hamburg trade lane.\n Short-term Contracts and Market High Position Here we can see the same short term contracts but the market position is now focused on the market high, or, in other words, the highest prices paid on the market to ship freight on this trade lane.\n Long-term Contracts and Market Low Position Finally, we can see long-term contracts with the market low position — that is, the lowest prices paid by market participants.\n Summary The market metrics determine the parts of the freight rate market that Xeneta will show. In the examples above, the freight rate can vary drastically under different market metrics. The price of long-term contracts will differ from the short-term, and the market average value can be significantly different between the highest and lowest prices paid on the market.\nUnderstanding Your Metrics — Air Market metrics in Xeneta for Air Freight differ from Ocean freight in the following ways:\n Air freight uses only long-term contracts Air freight has a market metric tied to the service level of the cargo   Like Ocean freight, Xeneta uses three different market positions to show freight rates for the market average, low, and high segments.\nHowever, unlike Ocean freight, air freight is categorized by Xeneta into service levels. This is done to ensure that air cargo, which lacks the standardization of ocean freight, can be made comparable to other air cargo.\nIn general, the way Xeneta creates benchmarks for air freight differs from the way it is done for ocean freight. You can read more about our benchmarking methodology here.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s examine how the service level market metric affects the prices seen within the air freight search:\nMid-Tier Service Level and Market Average Here we can see the prices for air freight from Shanghai to Frankfurt at the market average.\n Mid-Tier Service Level and Market Low Contrast the price above with the same service tier but focused on the lowest price on the market. We can see that the spread between the market average and the market low is not very large.\n Low-Tier Service Level and Market Average Finally, we can look at the low-tier service level at the market average for the same trade lane.\n The difference between the low-tier and mid-tier air freight viewed at the market average provides a good insight into the value of service level offered by carriers. For instance, if you\u0026rsquo;re particularly price-sensitive, it would make sense to forgo some service level benefits — like shipping speed — for a lower price.\n"

	"content": " Overview Spend Analysis uses your uploaded volume data to calculate estimated savings and theoretical market spend in dollars.\nSpend Comparison The Spend Comparison — available on the Analytics dashboard — helps you compare the price you paid for your volume you have shipped against shipping the same volume at different market prices. The Spend Comparison panel compares your spend volume to the market low, average, and high spends.\nExample: If you ship 100 TEU at $100 each, the value of My Covered Spend will be $10,000. If the price to ship at the market low is $80, then the value of Market Low Spend will be $8000 ($80 × 100).\n For example, in the image below, My Covered Spend is calculated by adding up all your shipped volumes and their associated prices across all your trade lanes. The three Market Spend values are calculated by taking the same volume and trade lanes but using Xeneta\u0026rsquo;s market data for the price instead.\n In our example, we can see that the My Covered Spend values are actually below the Market Average Spend, which suggests that in total the prices we have paid to ship our cargo are reasonable. Nonetheless, they are still above the Market Low Spend, which expresses the lowest prices paid on the market.\nSaving Potentials The Saving Potential is a calculation of the savings possible for your shipped volume given that the prices for those volumes improve if they use market prices instead of the prices you supplied. It is available on the Analytics dashboard and as part of the Spend Overview.\n In other words, the Saving Potential reflects the possible savings that can be achieved if your worst-performing trade lanes are negotiated to rates matching the market.\nSpend Overview The Spend Overview ties together your volume and prices with Xeneta\u0026rsquo;s market data. As with any analytics page in Xeneta, the Spend Overview is affected by market metrics.\n The Saving Potential at the corridor level combines all possible savings from the trade lanes available within the corridor. It gives you a view into the corridors that would benefit the most from better prices.\nNot all of your spend may be covered by Xeneta. If you have rates for small and uncommon trade lanes, Xeneta may not have enough coverage to provide an analysis.\nThe My Covered Spend column shows how much of your total spend is covered by Xeneta. This is also the value that is compared against the market benchmark to calculate a savings potential.\n  Using the filters available on the page, you can drill down to the port level and find the exact prices you have paid to ship on your trade lanes.

Use the dashboard search or your followed trade lanes to reach the Benchmarks graph.\nSelecting Filters The report exported by Xeneta is affected by the filters you select for the Benchmarks graph. The filters that affect the data exported to the Excel report are as follows:\n Origin and destination Date range Container type Contract duration THC methodology  All other data related to the benchmarks — including market positions and rate quality — will be included by default. All of your uploaded freight rates available for the selected date range will appear as separate sheets in the exported report, separated by supplier name.\n Generating the Graph Once you have selected the filters that capture the data you wish to export, click the \r icon in the top-right corner of the page to generate the Excel report.\nDepending on the size of your dataset, generating the report may take some time. Once it is ready, the report will automatically download to your computer.\nUnderstanding the Report Data The exported data will map your supplier prices for the selected origin-destination pair to Xeneta\u0026rsquo;s benchmark prices for every day included in the date range filter.\nRefer to this article for more information about the meaning of each column in the Excel report.\r   Working with Report Data With the report available to you, you can use Excel features to transform and manipulate the data.\nCreating a Table Creating a table will let you sort and filter your data in Excel. You can create a table in the following way:\n1) Select all data columns in the Raw Data sheet.\n 2) From the Excel Ribbon display, select Insert \u0026gt; Table.\n 3) Check the My table has headers option and click OK.\n Your data will now be structured as a typical Excel table, which can be used to filter and sort your data to your preference.\n Creating Charts If you wish to see alternate visualizations of freight benchmark data, you can use Excel to create charts from the exported dataset. In this example, we\u0026rsquo;ll focus on creating a basic line chart with a trend line that captures the general movement of the market average freight rate.\n1) Select the Day, My Price, Market Average, Market Low, and Market High columns in the Excel report.\n 2) Navigate to Insert and select the 2-D Line Graph chart option.\n 3) A line graph will be generated based on the benchmark data and the date will automatically be used as the x-axis.\n 4) Click on the chart and then on the green cross in the top-right corner of the chart to open the Chart Elements menu.\n 5) Select the Trendline option and then Market Average and click OK.\n6) A dotted trendline for the Market Average benchmark will be added to your graph.\n Summary Exported reports provide an additional layer of analysis on top of the Xeneta platform. Using Xeneta\u0026rsquo;s data with Excel can be useful for exploring benchmarking data and understanding the market.\n"

It does so by providing three views of the market:\n The historical rate trends The current day\u0026rsquo;s rate The trends of rates that run into the future or begin in the future  In the third case, Xeneta offers a short view of the future by showing contracted freight rates that extend past the current day. We refer to this as the Contract Horizon, and it is particularly useful for understanding the developing trends in the freight market as it moves into the future.\nTo understand the Contract Horizon, let\u0026rsquo;s first walk through how Xeneta visualizes rates and how rates are filtered based on their age.\nVisualizing Rates We can visualize Xeneta\u0026rsquo;s rate data by viewing it as a collection of lines: the length of each line representing the duration of a contracted rate and its vertical position representing the price that the rate was negotiated at.\nXeneta creates a benchmark value by combining all valid rates for a single day into one number.\n In the example above, the average benchmark price provided by Xeneta for today can be calculated by taking the arithmetic average of the 5 rates on our graph that pass through the blue dashed line. In this case, the market benchmark will be $300.\nThis is the most basic scenario of how Xeneta presents rates from across the market as a single value that is used for benchmarking.\nContracted Within By default, Xeneta combines all contracts available in a single day into one price.\nThis includes contracts that were created in the past as well as those created recently. This means that long-term contracts from several months ago will influence the benchmark price provided by Xeneta.\nIf you are interested in the most current freight rates available on the market, you can choose to exclude older contracts by using the Contracted Within filter. This allows you to see only those rates that were recently contracted. This should give you a clear picture of the prices most-recently agreed upon by market participants.\n In our example, if we calculate the market average for only those contracts that start within the scope of the Contracted Within filter for 3 months — the contracts that start within the pink region — we find that the market average value is $350.\nThis suggests that, by looking only at newer contracts, the market is moving towards a higher average price.\nContract Horizon Finally, Xeneta is able to look at contracts that run past the current day or are contracted to begin some time in the future.\nThese contracts — located at what Xeneta refers to as the Contract Horizon — contain additional information about the state of the freight market for the coming 3 months.\nConsider that any contract set to begin in the future has to be negotiated near the present day. Because such contracts begin in the future, they will not be visible as part of the historical rate or the current day\u0026rsquo;s rate.\n Nonetheless, these contracts set the basis for the market rates in the coming months. By looking at the Contract Horizon, you can see where market participants have decided to position their freight rates in the near future, and how long-running contracts overlap with them.\nContracted Within and Contract Horizon Finally, you can combine the Contracted Within filter with the Contract Horizon to see only the most recent contracts that extend into the future.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll look at two examples: a view of rates half way into the Contract Horizon and a view of the same rates at the very end of the Contract Horizon.\nExample 1 In this example, we\u0026rsquo;ll set the scope of the Contracted Within filter to 3 months and will look at the middle of the Contract Horizon — one and a half months into the future.\n We can see that only contracts 2, 3, and 7 will be valid for the given period. The older contracts — 1, 4, and 5 — will be excluded based on their age. Lastly, contract 6 will be excluded because it will only be valid in the future. If we calculate the market average using our valid rates, we\u0026rsquo;ll find that its value will be $250.\nExample 2 In our second example, we\u0026rsquo;ll look at the very last day of the Contract Horizon with the Contracted Within filter of 3 months applied. This means that at the end of the Contract Horizon, 3 months past the current day, the oldest contract could only begin from today\u0026rsquo;s date. This means that you see the most current view of the market — a view that is least affected by older long-term rates.\n This view of the freight market shows us the absolutely newest contracts that have been negotiated, and the ones least affected by older long-term contracts.\nIn this example, only two contracted rates begin in the future, and their market average value is $100. By looking at the market in this way, we can get a sense of where the price of future contracts is trending.\nWhy is the Contract Horizon limited to 3 months? Due to the nature of the freight market, market participants simply do not negotiate contracts to start very far into the future.\nXeneta cannot show freight data past the Contract Horizon because such data simply does not exist.\nAdditionally, the further you look into the future, the fewer rates are available since older long-term rates begin to expire and fewer new long-term rates are contracted ahead of time. If you look too far into the future, there will simply be no data for Xeneta to show.\nFurther Reading  Guides — Market Rates Beyond Today  "

	"content": " \rIn this guide, we\u0026rsquo;ll look at the Contract Horizon feature to examine where the freight market is trending past the present day.\r Introduction The Xeneta platform provides market trends and benchmarks based on current and historical freight rates. Of course, in the cycle of freight procurement and contract negotiation, new shipping contracts are always being established.\nIn these cases, the contracts negotiated near the present day may be contracted to start a few weeks or months in the future — but they are still signed today and reflect today\u0026rsquo;s market. In other cases, long-term contracts that extend past the present day also reflect the near-present market because they tend to be stable compared to the prices of short-term contracts.\nUsing the Market Horizon feature, you can extend your view of the Benchmarks and Trends graphs by three months.\nViewing the Contract Horizon To enable the Contract Horizon, start by clicking on the right-side of the date range picker on the graphs page.\n Next, click Show Futures from the dialog that opens.\n Finally, the graph will update to show an additional three months of data, indicated by a gray background on the graph.\n Understanding the Contract Horizon The Contract Horizon is simply additional data about the state of the freight market. Having access to the Market Horizon is most useful in scenarios where having as many details as possible about the market is vital to your logistics strategy.\nIf there is a contracted price for shipping freight that is valid for one year and began three months ago, it would be considered part of the Contract Horizon because it extends for nine months into the future. Similarly, if there is a recently formed contract that is set to become valid within a month, then this too would be part of the Contract Horizon because it is set to happen past the current day.\nAnything on the Contract Horizon, with time, will eventually become part of regular historical data. It can be thought of as a window into the very first contracts being formed for future dates.\nSetting the Scope Like the regular Benchmarks and Trends graphs, the Contract Horizon is also affected by the Contracted Within filter. As such, your view of the Market Horizon will vary based on how you choose to filter contracts based on their age.\nThree Views of the Future In this example, we\u0026rsquo;ll consider a four month period where three of the months are part of the Contract Horizon. We\u0026rsquo;ll explore three different Contracted Within filter settings:\n All long-term contracts Long-term contracts created within the last 6 months Long-term contracts created within the last 3 months  All Long-term Contracts By including all long-term contracts as part of the Contract Horizon, we can see that the price of shipping from Shanghai to Hamburg remains steady for contracts running beyond the current day.\n This view does not reveal very much because older long-term contracts tend to outnumber newer and younger contracts, such that the state of the market reflects the aged majority of contracts.\nLong-term Contracts No Older Than 6 Months If we apply the Contracted Within filter to exclude all contracts older than 6 months, we get the following view of the market:\n The average freight rate seen on the market begins to move slightly from month to month, showing less stability than the previous case.\nLong-term Contracts No Older Than 3 Months Finally, by looking at only contracts that were created within the past 3 months, we get the \u0026ldquo;freshest\u0026rdquo; view of the freight market.\n Unlike the other two views, this view suggests that the prices for the newest contracts on the market will in fact be higher when entering August before dropping a bit in September.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll notice that the line depicting the market average disappears when entering October. This is because there do not exist enough contracts that are at most three months old and run into the future for the platform to display in aggregate.\nThe conclusion we can draw here is that the market participants that are entering freight contracts near to the present day appear to be paying higher prices for shipments scheduled in the coming months.\nFurther Reading Concepts — Contract Horizon →\r\r "

	"content": " Introduction As markets develop and react to economic circumstances, it is important to be aware of all your tendering options. With Xeneta you can\nYou could reasonably forecast that locking in a long-term contract at current rate levels would be undesirable.\nA Look at Long-term Contracts Consider the following historical trend for long-term contracts from 20-10-2018  to 20-10-2020  on the China East Main to North Europe Main:\n View example in Xeneta  In this 2-year period, the market sees fluctuates considerably. When would be the ideal time to tender?\nUsing the Benchmarks graph from Xeneta, we can compare the market average to actual rates from our suppliers. As an example, we\u0026rsquo;ll take a look at the rates offered by an anonymized supplier (in brown):\n We can see that at the start of our plotted period the rates offered by our supplier sit well below the market. Soon the market drops considerably and we renegotiate our contract for the next year down to take that into account.\nOur year-long contract safeguards us from the rate spike at the beginning of 2020. When it comes time to tender again, we decide to pursue a 3-month contract due to the uncertainty caused by COVID-19. In turn, we pay a higher rate for our freight.\nA Look at Short-term Contracts If we take a look at the short-term contracts market for the same period, we quickly realize that our long-term contracts helped us weather significant volatility.\n View example in Xeneta  If we continued to rely on short-term contracts past August 2020, we would have seen significant increase in costs given the substantial jump in rates starting in September 2020. Instead, we elected to lock in another long-term contract and thus avoided the rate increases.\nLeveraging the Contract Horizon By default, Xeneta only shows market data for the current day and historically. However, given that long-term contracts may extend beyond the current day or begin in the future, Xeneta can display this limited set of rate data to provide additional insight.\nIf we take a look at our earlier long-term market example again, but this time with the Contract Horizon enabled, we see the following:\n View example in Xeneta  The gray area covers a period of 3 months past the current day. In this case, it indicates that long-term contract rates will begin to rise — mirroring the behavior of the short-term market.\nWhile not a perfect prediction of the future, it does provide a strong indication that it may be worthwhile to lock in a long-term contract as soon as possible in order to ensure that your freight rates remain below the market.\n"

	"content": " Introduction It\u0026rsquo;s important to set your budget as you go into tender. If you\u0026rsquo;ve been out of the market for some time, Xeneta can help you align expectations and forecast possible budget increases or decreases.\nGlobal Market Trends You can use the Global Market Trends to see corridor price changes between the present day and up to a year in the past.\n View example in Xeneta  By setting the Display parameter to the Past 1 Year, you can quickly find how the corridors that are relevant to your organization have been impacted.\n Benchmarks Graph Using the Benchmarks graph, you can plot your current freight rates against the market rates. It is the simplest way to see how much the market differs from your contracted rates.\nIn the example below, you can see that the short-term market rates begin to sharply rise over the course of half a year.\n View example in Xeneta  By the middle of October 2020, the difference between market prices and currently valid contrated rates is staggering. An organization about to tender at the end of 2020 should be aware that their budget will need to be much larger to accomodate shipping freight under these market conditions.\nAuto-Generated Reports If you\u0026rsquo;ve been using Xeneta for some time, you will have accumulated a number of monthly spend reports. These reports contain your own spend and the corresponding market spend for your relevant trade lanes and corridors. In particular, they contain the following columns:\n My Covered Spend Performance Relative to Market Average Spend (in %) My Covered Spend Performance Relative to Market Low Spend (in %) My Covered Spend Performance Relative to Market High Spend (in %)  By knowing your spend relative to the market in the months leading up to tender, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to set budget expectations.\nFor example, if your spend performance on your largest trade corridors is well below the market, you may need to prepare for a price correction and expect needing a bigger budget to ship your freight.\n"
