## Introduction

Xeneta can organize your uploaded data by individual suppliers, which will let you identify your best and worst performing suppliers.

## Supplier Breakdown

You can see the volume, spend, and saving potentials of all of your suppliers by navigating to the **Suppliers** tab of the Spend Overview.

The **Covered vs. Market** column indicates the level to which your rates are above or below the market for the same trade lanes. 

The **Saving Potential** column indicates the theoretical savings that can be achieved if your most expensive trade lanes matched market prices. 

As a whole, the suppliers with the highest saving potentials are good targets for investigation into why their prices are above the market.
