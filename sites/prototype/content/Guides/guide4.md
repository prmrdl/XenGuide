## Introduction

In Xeneta, you can find today's freight rates between any two locations using the [search]({{< ref "portsearch.md" >}}) on the dashboard. 

If you're interested in a number of lanes, you can use the **Follow** button from any search result to add it to your followed trends. You can then view your followed trends to get a full list of trade lanes relevant to you.

The six trade lanes that you have most-recently followed will appear at the bottom of the [dashboard]({{< ref "Ocean/overview.md" >}}).
