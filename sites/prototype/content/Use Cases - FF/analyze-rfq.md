## Introduction

Xeneta can help you be efficient and quick when dealing with RFQs. As the tender process continues over the weeks, it's important to stay up to date on price developments and to be able to inform the customers why rates cannot always be adjusted.

The Xeneta platform, as a neutral party, can ground your rates to market realities â€” giving your customers the confidence that the prices they see are not arbitrary or extortionate.
