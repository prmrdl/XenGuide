## Introduction

The Tender process can be cumbersome and prone to manual work. You can use Xeneta in your tender process to populate data quickly and accurately â€” especially for trade lanes you may not normally work with.

## Tender Benchmark

The Tender Benchmark is an Excel report populated with Xeneta market data side by side with your bids for each supplier. It allows you to provide simple origin and destination port combinations in an Excel sheet.

If you're going through the tender process, our analysts will work with you to get your rates into the Xeneta platform. The simplest way to hand off your rates to our team is through our data upload page:

{{< linkbutton link="https://app.xeneta.com/my-account/my-company/upload-rates" >}} Upload Prices in Xeneta {{< /linkbutton >}}

Once your rates are uploaded, our Rate Management Team will work with you to help you understand how your bids compare to the market.
