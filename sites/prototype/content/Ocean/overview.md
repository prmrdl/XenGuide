{{% header %}} The <a href="https://app.xeneta.com/ocean/dashboard" target="_blank">Ocean dashboard</a> summarizes your freight spend information and provides a search box for finding market prices for trade lanes. {{% /header %}}

## Overview

The Ocean dashboard ties together all the key pieces of information about your freight spend in a single page. It's a good starting point for understanding your position in the freight market.

Once you have the basics down, you can use the dashboard to quickly navigate to deeper analytics provided by Xeneta. The [port-to-port search]({{< ref "Ocean/portsearch.md" >}}) is a core tool for finding current and historical prices for trade lanes and trade corridors across the world. The My Spend and My Prices sections of the dashboard connect you to expanded details about your freight prices.

## My Spend 

At a glance, the My Spend section of the dashboard provides the volume of your shipped freight (in TEU), a spend comparison against the market, and a calculation about potential savings (in USD) that could be achieved if your freight rates matched the three different market categories.

The section contains five links that direct you to different to the **My Spend** analytics pages with pre-set filters that express the dashboard information in more details.

In particular, the **View Comparison** link will provide a concrete comparison between your freight spend and the comparable market spend. Similarly, the **View Savings Potential** link will highlight the corridors where spend performance can be improved.


## My Prices

The My Prices section of the dashboard details the amount of your prices covered by Xeneta, as well as a snapshot of your prices that fall above or below the market.

As with the My Spend section, each summary card under the My Prices section contains a link to expanded spend information. The **View Prices Below** and **View Prices Above** links are useful for determining on what lanes and corridors your prices fall below market expectations.
