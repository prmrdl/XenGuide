{{% header %}} The <a href="https://app.xeneta.com/ocean/dashboard" target="_blank">Ocean dashboard</a> summarizes your freight spend information and provides a search box for finding market prices for trade lanes. {{% /header %}}

## Overview

The Ocean dashboard contains a [port-to-port search]({{< ref "Ocean/portsearch.md" >}}) and a number of sub-sections that detail your performance against the market. You can use the dashboard to understand your position in the market and to quickly navigate between different features of Xeneta.

## My Spend 

The My Spend section of the dashboard brings together the relevant information about your freight rates. At a glance, it provides the volume of your shipped freight (in TEU) and a spend comparison against the market and a calculation about potential savings that could be achieved if your freight rates matched the three different market categories.

## My Prices

The My Prices section of the dashboard details the amount of your prices covered by Xeneta, as well as a snapshot of your prices that fall above or below the market.

Followed lanes are added to the bottom of the dashboard and show their current price as well as changes in the price since the week before.
