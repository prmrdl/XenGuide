{{% header %}} The <a href="https://app.xeneta.com/ocean/dashboard" target="_blank">Ocean dashboard</a> summarizes your freight spend information and provides a search box for finding market prices for trade lanes. {{% /header %}}

## Overview

The Ocean dashboard ties together all the key pieces of information about your freight spend in a single page. It's a good starting point for understanding your position in the freight market.

Once you have the basics down, you can use the dashboard to quickly navigate to deeper analytics provided by Xeneta. The [port-to-port search]({{< ref "Ocean/portsearch.md" >}}) is a core tool for finding current and historical prices for trade lanes and trade corridors across the world. The My Spend and My Prices sections of the dashboard connect you to expanded details about your freight prices.

## My Spend 

The My Spend section of the dashboard brings together the relevant information about your freight rates. At a glance, it provides the volume of your shipped freight (in TEU), a spend comparison against the market, and a calculation about potential savings that could be achieved if your freight rates matched the three different market categories.

## My Prices

The My Prices section of the dashboard details the amount of your prices covered by Xeneta, as well as a snapshot of your prices that fall above or below the market.
