{{% header %}} Graphs are a tool for visualizing	 your freight rates in relation to the market and your own suppliers. {{% /header %}}

## Overview

Xeneta provides three types of graphs to help you understand your rates: 

* [The Benchmarks graph]({{< ref "#benchmarks-graph" >}})
* [The Trends graph]({{< ref "#trends-graph" >}})
* [The Carrier Spread graph]({{< ref "#carrier-spread" >}})

All graphs in Xeneta have a number of filters to help you narrow the scope of the rates you're viewing, including filters for date range, container type, contract duration, and terminal handling charges (THC).

{{% tip %}} Graphs can be reached from the port-to-port search, the Market Trends page, the My Prices page, and the Spend Overview. {{% /tip %}}

## Benchmarks Graph

The Benchmarks graph helps you compare the rates you pay for your freight suppliers against the market at large across specific trade lanes or regions. Once you've <a href="{{< ref "Introduction/uploading.md" >}}" target="_blank">uploaded your rates</a> into Xeneta, you'll be able to see them plotted against the market average, market low, and market high price benchmarks provided by Xeneta.

{{% tip %}} The Benchmarks graph functionality is only available if you've uploaded your freight rates into Xeneta. You can upload prices by visiting the [Upload Prices](https://app.xeneta.com/my-company/upload-rates) page. {{% /tip %}}

## Trends Graph

The Trends graph helps you visualize the movement of market prices on a trade lane — for both short-term and long-term contracts — over time.

Additionally, you can find a small summary of price movements for the selected time period beneath the graph:

### Trends Graph — Future Rates

Future rates are a feature of the Trends graph that lets you view long-term contracts that extend past the current day.

{{< fig src="../graphs-futures.png" text="Enabling future rates on the Trends graph." >}}

Once enabled, you will be able to see long-term contract rates for up to 3 months into the future.
