{{% header %}} The <a href="https://app.xeneta.com/ocean/spend/corridors" target="_blank">Spend Overview</a> page ties together your freight volume and its associated prices with the rest of the market. {{% /header %}}

## Overview

The Spend Overview helps you understand how much your freight prices can improve in terms of dollar value. Xeneta refers to this as the Saving Potential — the theoretical savings that can be achieved if the prices you paid for freight matched the price paid by different segments of the market.

## Spend Overview Categories

Your Spend Overview can be filtered and grouped within the following categories:

* Corridors
* Origins
* Destinations
* Suppliers
* Container types

You can select these categories using the tab navigation at the top of the Spend Overview.

Like the My Prices page, selecting a category from the Spend Overview will group your prices based on your selection. 

Clicking on a row in the Spend Overview page will take you to the **All Spend** tab, which will use your selected row as a filter for your spend.

## All Spend

The **All Spend** tab shows your port-to-port spend and your savings potential — along with other details like your supplier for the trade lane and the container type that was used. 

### My Spend Details

Clicking on a row on the **All Spend** tab will open up a dialog that provides additional  details about your port-to-port freight rate. The bottom of the dialog contains the **Open Trade Lane Graph** button, which will take you to the <a href="{{< ref "/Ocean/graphs.md#benchmarks-graph" >}}" target="_blank">Benchmarks graph</a> for the selected trade lane with all associated filters pre-set.
