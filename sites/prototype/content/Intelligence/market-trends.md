The **Market Trends** is a collection of trade lanes and corridors available for quick review. It features rate price information for today's date and a selectable date in the past, along with a small graph that shows the general trend for the trade lane for a selected period.

It contains two tabs:

{{% note %}}

{{% phead title="Rate Movements" %}} This view allows you to see how market rates have changed for different periods up to a year back in time. {{% /phead %}}

{{% /note %}}

{{% note %}}

{{% phead title="Short vs. Long" %}} This view allows you to compare how both short-term rates and long-term have changed for a given period. {{% /phead %}}
