The **Market Trends** is a collection of trade lanes and corridors available for quick review. It features rate price information for today's date and a selectable date in the past, along with a small graph that shows the general trend for the trade lane for a selected period. 

{{< fig src="/img/followed-market-trends.png" >}}

It contains two tabs:

{{% note %}}

{{% phead title="Following" %}} A list of trade lanes or corridors that you have added to your list of followed trade lanes. {{% /phead %}}

{{% phead title="Global Trends" %}} A list of the largest trade corridors in the world, as defined by Xeneta. {{% /phead %}}

{{% /note %}}

Additionally, within each tab, you can choose to view individual rate movements as defined by market metrics, or you can compare the price changes of short-term rates against long-term rates.

# Two Views of Market Movements

Both the **Following** and **Global Trends** tabs have two options for visualizing changes in the market:

{{% note %}}

{{% phead title="Rate Movements" %}} This view allows you to view and compare how market rates have changed for different periods up to a year back in time. {{% /phead %}}

{{% phead title="Short vs. Long" %}} This view allows you to compare how both short-term rates and long-term have changed for a given period. {{% /phead %}}

{{% /note %}}

Both types of visualizations are affected by the market metrics on the page. The views have a number of options to help you choose the period you wish to view, as well as a filter for container types. Additionally, you can select to view the rate movements in USD or as a percentage.

By clicking on the {{< inlineimg src="/img/3-dots-icon.png" >}} icon, you will be able to view the full graph associated with each followed trade lane for additional details and historical data.
