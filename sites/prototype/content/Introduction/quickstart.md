### View prices above or below the market

### Analyze potential savings

The [Spend Overview](https://app.xeneta.com/ocean/spend/corridors) uses your uploaded volume data to calculate a theoretical market price for others shipping similar volumes. The Spend Overview provides a savings potential across your corridors and tradelanes, thus giving you clear points of focus for reducing your freight spend.
