One of the core features of the Xeneta platform is the ability to benchmark your rates against the market. Benchmarking is another way of saying "comparing" â€” that is, you compare the prices you pay for shipping against other market participants as a whole.

Benchmarking can help you understand how much you pay relative to the market and can, in turn, give you the insight you need to negotiate better rates in the future.

To benchmark data within Xeneta, you will need to upload your rates to the platform. You can upload your rates in two ways:

### Upload Prices within Xeneta

You can upload prices at any time within Xeneta by clicking the {{< inlineimg src="../upload-icon.png" >}} icon from the main navigation menu or by visiting the <a href="https://app.xeneta.com/my-company/upload-rates" target="_blank">Upload Prices</a> page.

### Contact Our Rate Management Team

You can also reach out to our [Rate Management Team] if you want to deliver your rates in another way.
