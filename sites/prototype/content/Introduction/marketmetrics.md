Market metrics are a set of options that control how freight rate data is displayed in Xeneta. You can think of them as a global-level filters for rate information.

 They appear in the top-right corner of on any pages capable of showing freight data â€” including Air and Ocean dashboards.

Currently, Xeneta uses 3 types of market metrics across both Ocean and Air freight products:

* Contract duration
* Market position
* Service levels

It is important to select the right market metrics when viewing data in Xeneta because market metrics determine the data you will be shown.

For example, if you're looking at the **My Prices** page, you have a number of combinations for the market metrics available to you. You can look at short-term contracts as they compare to the market average, or you can take a look at long-term contracts as they compare to the market low, for instance.
