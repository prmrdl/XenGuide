Xeneta can create a number of Excel reports based on the analytics data found on our platform.

Any page capable of exporting an Excel report will contain a {{< inlineimg src="../export-icon.png" >}} symbol in the top-right corner of the page. You can find all your created reports on the [Reports](https://app.xeneta.com/ocean/reports/custom) page.

{{% note %}} <strong>Note</strong>: A number of larger reports will take some time to generate. In such cases, you'll be notified by email when your report is ready. {{% /note %}}
