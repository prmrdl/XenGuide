	"content": " Introduction Xeneta categorizes your air freight rates based on three different service levels: \u0026ldquo;Upper Tier\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Mid Tier\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Lower Tier\u0026rdquo;. This allows a direct comparison to other market rates that are most similar to yours. The reason for standardizing and categorizing these rates is because many freight forwarders use different names for their service levels. Re-categorizing and renaming these service levels allows us to more easily standardize and compare the rates directly with others in the market.\nThe categorization of each rate is done by our team of data analysts to ensure that a proper comparison can be made between your rates and the market. If you have any concerns or would like to further discuss the Xeneta Service Level that your rate(s) have been assigned to, feel free to contact our rate management team at RMT@xeneta.com to discuss them and make any necessary changes.\nThe rate characteristics below are an example of how we might classify which tier your rates belong in. In some cases, particular rates may not always follow this scheme if there are other characteristics that would indicate that it be better suited in another tier, but this is a general overview of how they are characterized in many cases.\n[image]\nThe service level your rate has been assigned to is visible from the \u0026ldquo;My Prices\u0026rdquo; table under the column named \u0026ldquo;Xeneta Service Level\u0026rdquo;. This means that you can now see which service level your rate has been assigned to, then choose which service level from all market benchmarks that you\u0026rsquo;d like to compare it against. The \u0026ldquo;My Service Level\u0026rdquo; column refers to the service level name that you originally provided with your rates.\n[image]\nFor example, if you have a set of rates that have been assigned to the \u0026ldquo;Mid-tier\u0026rdquo; market metric, you may then choose the \u0026ldquo;Mid-tier\u0026rdquo; service level from the upper-right area of the screen to compare your rates with all market rates that are considered Mid-tier.\n[image]\nAs always, the Market Low, Market Average, and Market High comparisons apply to this selection. If you have \u0026ldquo;Mid-tier\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Market Average\u0026rdquo; selected within the market metrics menu, you will be comparing all of your rates against the market average price for mid-tier service levels on the trade lane.\nService Level Filter Xeneta categorizes air freight rates based on three service levels: upper tier, mid tier, and lower tier. You can use the service level filter on the My Prices page to focus only on particular service levels for your air freight prices.\n[image]\nTo be able to make accurate air freight comparisons, you should filter your service level so that it matches the service level for your prices.\n[Air freight has an extra dimension when compared to ocean rates, which is what we refer to as Service Level. In the ocean product, the user only selects either market low, market average, or market high to compare themselves with. In air, they must select one of those options, as well as the service level that they want to compare their prices with.\nAdding an extra filter to My Prices allows the user to only see specific service levels within the data table, then compare only those prices with the service levels and market metric that they’ve selected at the top right dropdown selector on the screen. This means that they will no longer be comparing all of their rates with various service types- only the ones that they’ve specified.]\nExample A user would like to compare their own mid-tier rates against the market average price for mid-tier rates. They can do this with the following steps:\nNavigate to the My Prices page and select the Corridors tab Select Mid-tier from the service level dropdown menu Select Market average from the market metric selector in the top-right corner The prices displayed in the table will now only contain mid-tier prices. The user can now see which corridors have poor price performance for mid-tier rates and can then drill down into the data table to identify specific trade lanes that perform poorly against the market benchmark.\n"
