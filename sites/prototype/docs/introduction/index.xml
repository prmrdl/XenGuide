      <description>One of the core features of the Xeneta platform is the ability to benchmark your rates against the market. Benchmarking is another way of saying &amp;ldquo;comparing&amp;rdquo; — that is, you compare the prices you pay for shipping against other market participants as a whole.
Benchmarking can help you understand how much you pay relative to the market and can, in turn, give you the insight you need to negotiate better rates in the future.</description>

      <description>To categorize and analyze the movement of freight, Xeneta organizes ports into regional and sub-regional groups. The mapping is done to give a better view into the way geography plays into freight prices. To reflect this, nearby ports with similar costs of shipping will be grouped together.
Geographic Hierarchy The availability of freight data fluctuates throughout the year and Xeneta may not always have optimal freight rate coverage to provide to the user.</description>
